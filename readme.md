### Project Description
PepPal is an interactive chatbot designed to provide emotional support and entertainment through engaging conversations. Utilizing natural language processing and sentiment analysis, PepPal detects the user's emotional state based on their messages and responds with empathy, humor, or uplifting messages. Whether you're feeling happy, sad, or just in need of a laugh, PepPal is here to listen and engage, making each conversation a unique experience.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
PepPal, the chatbot ready to tackle the absurdity of human emotions! Because let‚Äôs be real, sometimes you just need to vent about your day or share a laugh about that time you tripped over your own feet in front of your crush.
So, we‚Äôre here to solve the ridiculous problem of lonely feelings in a digital world‚Äîbecause even virtual conversations deserve a sprinkle of joy, a dash of empathy, and maybe a joke about penguins!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing PepPal‚Äîyour personal emotional cheerleader, life coach, and part-time comedian! Forget the days of aimlessly scrolling through memes or talking to your houseplants (they don‚Äôt respond, we promise). With PepPal, you‚Äôll have a chatbot friend who‚Äôs always ready to listen, offer witty banter, and throw in the occasional dad joke just to lighten the mood.
Here's how it works:
Feelings Detector 3000: With our cutting-edge emotion analysis (aka some good ol' keyword searching), PepPal can decode your feelings faster than you can say ‚Äúemotional baggage.‚Äù Whether you‚Äôre feeling jubilant, sad, or just in need of a good laugh, PepPal‚Äôs got you covered.
Consoling Comedy: When you express your sorrows, PepPal won‚Äôt just offer sympathy; it‚Äôll serve up warm-hearted responses that feel like a virtual hug. And when you‚Äôre happy? Get ready for a series of fun questions that'll keep the positivity flowing‚Äîlike a never-ending fountain of joy (minus the water).
Joke Central: Need a laugh? PepPal‚Äôs library of cheesy jokes will have you rolling your eyes and chuckling at the same time. Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!
Sing-Along Support: Got a song stuck in your head? Just tell PepPal, and it‚Äôll serenade you with lyrics or even remind you of a catchy tune. Who needs a karaoke machine when you have a chatbot with rhythm?
